Running Environment
===================
This code is supposed to be run on UNIX machines. The following
commands are required:

- g++
- make
- split

All methods require MPI libraries. Available implementations include

- OpenMPI
You can find the information about OpenMPI at

http://www.open-mpi.org/

- MPICH

Usage
=====
To compile the code, type

	> make

To train a model distributedly, we provide a script "split.py" to split data into segments.
This scripts requires a file of the node list, and one core is treated as one node.
Namely, if you wish to use n > 1 cores on one machine, just duplicate this machine on the list n times.
We provide an example of the node list in the file "machinelist"
Assume the original training file name is trainfile,
then the segmented filenames will be trainfile.00,
trainfile.1,...
The enumeration starts from 0, and all files are of the same number of digits for enumeration.
To see the full usage of this script, type

	> python split.py

The segmented files will then be copied to the machines


To run the package, type

	> mpirun -hostfile machinelist ./train

and see the usage.
